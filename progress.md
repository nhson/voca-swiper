## Current State

**Last Updated:** 2026-11-04
**Active Feature:** feat-002 — SM-2 scheduler (domain)
**Branch:** main

### What's Done

- [x] Project skeleton written by hand: `pubspec.yaml`, `analysis_options.yaml`, `lib/` (feature-first), `test/widget_test.dart`
- [x] Spec moved to `docs/SPEC.md`
- [x] Agent harness from harness-creator: `AGENTS.md` (+ `CLAUDE.md` import), `feature_list.json`, `progress.md`, `session-handoff.md`, `init.sh`; skill vendored at `.claude/skills/harness-creator`
- [x] Flutter 3.47.9 (Dart 3.13.7) installed via `brew install --cask flutter`; `flutter create` generated `android/` + `ios/`
- [x] Android: Android Studio + SDK installed; cmdline-tools added at `~/Library/Android/sdk/cmdline-tools/latest`; debug APK built and app boots on emulator `Medium_Phone_API_37.0` (API 37)
- [x] iOS: Xcode 27.2 + CocoaPods 1.17.0; app boots on iPhone 18 Pro simulator (iOS 27.2) → feat-001 done

### What's In Progress

- [ ] feat-002: SM-2 scheduler, test-first in `lib/core/srs/`

### What's Next

1. ~~First git commit~~ done
2. feat-002 (SM-2 scheduler), then feat-003 / feat-004

## Blockers / Risks

- [ ] System Java is 1.8; sdkmanager needs `JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home"` (Flutter/Gradle already use Android Studio's JDK).
- [ ] Word-list licensing (Cambridge YLE, Oxford 3000) unconfirmed — fine for family use, check before store release.

## Evidence of Completion

- [x] `./init.sh` — 2026-11-04: pub get OK, format 0 changed, analyze no issues, 1/1 test passed
